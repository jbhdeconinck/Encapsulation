# Encapsulation

- What is Encapsulation in Ruby? (3 sentences)

By encapsulation we mean the behavior of an object can only be affected through its own user interface (e.g. through an accessor).
An object is not well encapsulated when its behavior can be affected without calling its user interface.
Another way to think about it is that a well encapsulated object draws a solid boundry or wall around itself, and ensures that all the code that changes its behavior is contained within the object itself (i.e. not in another object).

How the concepts of encapsulation and SRP are intertwinned?

- Give an example of a poorly-encapsulated class that uses an attr_accessor.


- Explain why it is a poor example of Encapsulation
- Refactor the class to better use Encapsulation.
